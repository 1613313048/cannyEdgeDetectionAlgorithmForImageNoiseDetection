# cannyEdgeDetectionAlgorithmForImageNoiseDetection
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.

The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:
1)Noise reduction.
2)Gradient calculation.
3)Non-maximum suppression.
4)Double threshold.
5)Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.

1)Noise Reduction
   Since the mathematics involved behind the scene are mainly based on derivatives (cf. Step 2: Gradient calculation), edge detection results are highly sensitive to image noise.
   One way to get rid of the noise on the image, is by applying Gaussian blur to smooth it. To do so, image convolution technique is applied with a Gaussian Kernel (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 etcâ€¦). The kernel size depends on the expected blurring effect. Basically, the smallest the kernel, the less visible is the blur. In our example, we will use a 5 by 5 Gaussian kernel.
